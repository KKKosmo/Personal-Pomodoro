# Personal-Pomodoro

Pomodoro Project - Web application that uses PHP and MySQL. It is a tool that boosts and helps control one's productivity. What makes it unique is that the records are saved which can be analyzed through a detailed dashboard. It also features comments/notes instead of just numeric data, for better tracking.

-Future-proof in terms of not needing architecture updates as time passes by, as it auto generates panels based on the current data and date.

-Developed this to solve a personal problem of lacking productivity.


It also uses a bit of boostrap.

The timer system could definitely be improved
